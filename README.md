# formJSON

This script takes two fields from an HTML document and converts
it into a JSON object.  The object is then called in an console.log
to reveal the first and last name in those fields when the
submit butto is clicked.

Don't believe me.. just give it a try.

WCC Software Club use to parse forms into json to put into our
MongoDB.
